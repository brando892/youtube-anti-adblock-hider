# YT Adblock Warning Hider

**A small, precise filter that hides YouTube’s anti-adblock overlay popups, letting you watch videos without interruptions.**

This filter is surgical and focused — it only removes YouTube’s anti-adblock overlay/warning popups. It is minimal and precise — affects only the overlay; all other ad-blocking should be handled by your main blocker. Fully MV3-compliant and designed for AdGuard desktop browser extensions. Safe — playback, controls, and video content remain completely unaffected.

⚠️ Note: This filter does not block video ads — it only removes the overlay warnings about ad blockers.

### Why This Filter Works

Unlike other solutions that overcomplicate or rely on scripts, this filter takes a **surgical approach**: it hides only the annoying YouTube anti-adblock overlay without affecting video playback, controls, captions, or other UI elements. Lightweight, future-proof, and fully MV3-compliant, it works where default adblockers can’t, giving power users a simple, reliable way to enjoy YouTube without interruptions. Simple but effective — that’s the innovation.
