# YT Adblock Warning Hider

**A small, precise filter that hides YouTube’s anti-adblock overlay popups, letting you watch videos without interruptions.**

This filter is surgical and focused — it only removes YouTube’s anti-adblock overlay/warning popups. It is minimal and precise — affects only the overlay; all other ad-blocking should be handled by your main blocker. Fully MV3-compliant and designed for AdGuard desktop browser extensions. Safe — playback, controls, and video content remain completely unaffected.

⚠️ Note: This filter does not block video ads — it only removes the overlay warnings about ad blockers.

## Installation

**AdGuard Extension**  
1. Open AdGuard Extension → Settings → Filters → Custom Filters → Add URL  
2. Paste the raw URL of this filter:  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brando892/youtube-anti-adblock-hider/main/youtube-anti-adblock.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brando892/youtube-anti-adblock-hider/main/youtube-anti-adblock.txt)  
3. Click Apply / Save  
4. Reload YouTube — overlay warnings are hidden.


## Usage

Designed to complement your existing ad blocker. No additional configuration needed after adding the filter URL.
