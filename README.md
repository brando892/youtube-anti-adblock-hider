# YT Adblock Warning Hider

A small, precise filter that hides YouTube’s anti-adblock overlay popups, letting you watch videos uninterrupted.  

This filter is **surgical and focused** — it only removes YouTube’s anti-adblock overlay/warning popups. Minimal and precise, it affects **only the overlay**, leaving all other ad-blocking to your main blocker. Fully **MV3-compliant** and designed for **AdGuard desktop browser extensions**. Safe — playback, controls, captions, and video content remain completely unaffected.  

⚠️ **Note:** This filter does **not block video ads** — it only removes overlay warnings about ad blockers.

Lightweight, future-proof, and fully MV3-compliant, it works where default adblockers can’t, giving power users a **simple, reliable way to enjoy YouTube without interruptions**. Simple but effective — that’s the innovation.
